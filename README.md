# Blockchain-Models
A blockchain implimentation using Swift, this repository constains a basic outline of the blockchain server (A Vapor server hosted on macOS). The proposed server can be queried using JSON and would essentially have a REST API.

The below illustarted is the structure of the blockchain model :
We have 3 major components A Transaction, A Block and The Blockchain. There are 3 models in our server one for each.
The blockchain will consist of a number of blocks starting with the genesis block, each block will contain one or more transactions.
